Prompt "What is your age? "
Prompt "What age would you like to retire? "
    Check input age and input retireAge:
        if both are positive and digit:
            if retireAge greater then age:
                currentYear = getCurrentYearFunction
                retire = retireAge - age
                Print You have {retire} years left until you can retire.
                Print It's {currentYear}, so you can retire in {currentYear} + {retire}
            else
                Error
